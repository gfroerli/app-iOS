## Info
Gfr√∂r.li is a project that allows people to see local water temperatures in real-time.
We use self-built sensors, that measure the local temperature every 15 minutes and send them to our back-end using the The Things Network. From there we request the aggregated data to present them to the user.

## Contact
If you have some feedback and/or requests, including sponsoring or placing your own sensor, please contact us by [Email](mailto:appdev@coredump.ch) or via Mastodon [@coredump_ch](https://chaos.social/@coredump) or [@makram_95](https://swiss.social/@makram95)!
